Binary Search
=============

This is a Python implementation of the binary search algorithm. The
algorithm has a time complexity of ``O(log n)``, making it faster than
naive search which has a time complexity of ``O(n)``.

Getting Started
---------------

To use this implementation, import the ``binary_search`` function and
the necessary dependencies.

.. code:: python

   import json
   import random
   import time

   from binary_search import binary_search, naive_search

   with open('binary_search/data.json') as f:
       l = json.loads(f.read()).get("data")

The binary_search function takes in a sorted list and a target value,
and returns the index at which the target value is found in the list. If
the target value is not found in the list, the function returns -1.

.. code:: python

   target = "whisper"
   result = binary_search(l, target)
   print(result) # 7

The implementation also includes a naive_search function for comparison,
which has a time complexity of O(n).

.. code:: python

   result = naive_search(l, target)
   print(result) # 7

Performance
-----------

To compare the performance of binary_search and naive_search, the
implementation includes a simple benchmark that generates a sorted list
of random integers and searches for each element in the list using both
algorithms. The average search time for each algorithm is then
calculated and printed.

.. code:: python

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       length = 10000

       sorted_list = set()
       while len(sorted_list) < length:
           sorted_list.add(random.randint(-3*length, 3*length))

       sorted_list = sorted(list(sorted_list))

       start = time.time()
       for target in sorted_list:
           naive_search(sorted_list, target)
       end = time.time()
       print("Naive search time: ", (end-start)/length, "seconds")

       start = time.time()
       for target in sorted_list:
           binary_search(sorted_list, target)
       end = time.time()
       print("Binary search time: ", (end-start)/length, "seconds")
