Tic-Tac-Toe AI
==============

This code includes four classes for playing Tic-Tac-Toe:

-  ``Player``: An abstract class representing a player in the game.
-  ``HumanPlayer``: A subclass of ``Player`` that allows a human player
   to input their move.
-  ``RandomComputerPlayer``: A subclass of ``Player`` that chooses a
   random valid move.
-  ``SmartComputerPlayer``: A subclass of ``Player`` that uses the
   minimax algorithm to choose the best possible move.

``Player``
----------

The ``Player`` class has one attribute:

-  ``letter``: The letter (either ‘X’ or ‘O’) representing the player’s
   symbol in the game.

It has one method:

-  ``get_move(game)``: A method that returns the player’s chosen move
   for the given game. This method should be implemented in subclasses.

``HumanPlayer``
---------------

The ``HumanPlayer`` class is a subclass of ``Player`` that allows a
human player to input their move. It has no additional attributes or
methods.

``RandomComputerPlayer``
------------------------

The ``RandomComputerPlayer`` class is a subclass of ``Player`` that
chooses a random valid move. It has no additional attributes or methods.

``SmartComputerPlayer``
-----------------------

The ``SmartComputerPlayer`` class is a subclass of ``Player`` that uses
the minimax algorithm to choose the best possible move. It has one
additional method:

-  ``minimax(state, player)``: A recursive method that uses the minimax
   algorithm to determine the optimal move for the given player in the
   given state of the game. It returns a dictionary with the optimal
   position to move to and the score for that move.
